## Python + C (Codes) 
The following repository containts series of programs with an specific function, from games like rock paper sicssors, to text and string analysis and manipulation, as well as mathematical programs like finding values with a certain condition or the e constant.
There are 5 c language program and 5 python programs, making 10 in total.
Enough guidance is provided in the comments of each code, but here is the main description of the exercises:

### **A: Code Programs in C that do the following:** 

1. `char.c` = Write a program to input any character and check whether it is alphabet, digit or special character.  
2. `evenodd.c` = Write a program to check whether a number is even or odd. 
3. `maxnum.c` = Write a program to find maximum between three numbers. 
4. `rps.c` = Write a program to play "Paper, Rock or Scissors". 
5. `zodiac.c` = Write a program that display the Zodiacal Sign using the day and month of birth.

### **B: Code Programs in Python that do the following:**

1. `e.py` = Calculate the Euler constant e using the series:

2. `specialcharsdotpop.py` = Given a list of strings delete all special chars in each one (non-alphanumeric chars). 
3. `password.py` = Check the validity of a password (input from users). Validation: • At least 1 letter between [a-z] and 1 letter between [A-Z]. • At least 1 number between [0-9]. • At least 1 at least one punctuation sign. • Minimum length 6 characters. • Maximum length 16 characters. 
4. `wordfreqcounter.py` = Count the Word Frequency in a Text (Unique String). Don’t forget to: normalize to lower case and delete special chars. 
5. `matrixmult.py` = Compute the Matrix Multiplication between a matrix A and B. Don’t use any library.
